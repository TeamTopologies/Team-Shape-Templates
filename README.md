# Team Shape Templates

Templates for popular drawing and diagramming tools to represent the team types and team interaction modes in Team Topologies.

Based on some of the ideas in the book _Team Topologies_ by Matthew Skelton [@matthewskelton](https://github.com/matthewskelton) and Manuel Pais [@manupaisable](https://github.com/manupaisable).

## draw.io / diagrams.net

See [TeamTopologies.xml](diagrams.net/TeamTopologies.xml) in the _diagrams.net_ folder. This creates a Library with several shapes. The shapes are named - hover over a shape to see the description:
